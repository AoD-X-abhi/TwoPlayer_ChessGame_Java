## **File Structure**
- **`ChessGame.java`**: Manages the overall game logic and flow.
- **`ChessBoard.java`**: Represents the chessboard and handles the game state.
- **`ChessGameGUI.java`**: Implements the graphical user interface using Java Swing.
- **`ChessSquareComponent.java`**: Represents individual squares on the chessboard.
- **`Piece.java`**, **`PieceColor.java`** and **`Position.java`** are other neccessary Files setting colors for each piece and setting and initializing the positions.
- **Piece Files**:
  - `Bishop.java`
